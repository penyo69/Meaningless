README FIRST!

Hi there and welcome to Hello Neighbor Alpha 2.
 This is the first build of Hello Neighbor to have content that’s going into the final game.
 

- The HOUSE isn’t final, this is a small tutorial house
- 
The ART is final
- The Sound DIRECTION is final
- You can finally see your hands
- 
This gives you a SMALL taste of the final game

WORKS ONLY on 64 BIT WINDOWS MACHINES! 

Enjoy!
